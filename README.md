# ü§ñ AutoDev ‚Äì Autonomous AI Software Engineer

AutoDev is an intelligent, agentic AI software engineer designed to understand high-level human instructions, plan steps, perform research, and write code autonomously.

Built with LLMs, reasoning engines, and web automation tools, AutoDev brings the power of autonomous software development to your fingertips‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs building features, debugging, or launching full-stack applications.

> üìù **Inspired By:** Devin by Cognition AI  
> AutoDev is our open-source response‚Äîaiming to match (or exceed) Devin‚Äôs performance on the SWE-bench benchmark.

bun run start
Visit http://127.0.0.1:3001 to begin using AutoDev.

Usage
Launch the interface in your browser

Create or select a project

Choose your search engine and preferred LLM

Type your objective

AutoDev will analyze, plan, and execute

Track progress and iterate

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
On first launch, a config.toml file will be created in the root directory.

Use the settings UI to configure:

API Keys:

BING, GOOGLE_SEARCH, GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID

OPENAI, CLAUDE, GEMINI, MISTRAL, GROQ

NETLIFY (for deployment support)

API Endpoints:

Customize endpoints for OpenAI, Ollama, Google, and others.
